* WineNot |       
    * Developed optimization algorithms for wine blending using multi-objective linear programming (MOLP), simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms to automate the traditional wine assemblage process and overcome human sensory limitations in wine tasting.
    * Implemented multi-objective goal programming strategy to optimize multiple wine characteristics simultaneously (cost, phenols, tannins, alcohol level, etc.) and created user-friendly blending guidelines for home wine enthusiasts, achieving optimal blend ratios.
