    * Researched multivariate analysis in football analysis, exploring linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction, clustering, and biclustering. The goal was to leverage these techniques to improve objectivity in assessing player market values and ratings, reducing bias and enhancing reproducibility.
    * These unsupervised methods objectively identified skilled yet undervalued players and distinguished them from famous, high-cost players with underwhelming skills.

    * Developed optimization algorithms for wine blending using multi-objective linear programming (MOLP), simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms to automate the traditional wine assemblage process and overcome human sensory limitations in wine tasting.
    * Implemented multi-objective goal programming strategy to optimize multiple wine characteristics simultaneously (cost, phenols, tannins, alcohol level, etc.) and created user-friendly blending guidelines for home wine enthusiasts, achieving optimal blend ratios.
