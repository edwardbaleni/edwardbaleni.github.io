## Abstract

Tree-based machine learning algorithms have gained widespread acclaim as intuitive and adaptable analytical tools capable of effectively exploring nonlinear data structures. These methods have been successful in research involving infinite or large finite populations, such as those observed in ecological and spatially oriented studies. The algorithms in question are frequently constructed based on subsets of population data for analysis. A vulnerability of these tree-based models is their sensitivity to variable data. Therefore, models built on data from different sampling schemes may perform inconsistently, especially for data with varying levels of spatial dependency. As such, this paper seeks to provide guidance to researchers through the comparative analysis of the predictive performance of tree-based machine learning algorithms: random forests and extreme gradient boosting. Focusing on the effects of various sampling schemes and cross-validation (CV) on predicting a spatially dependent variable. For this purpose, aboveground biomass (AGB) has been selected as a spatially autocorrelated data source. This biophysical variable is crucial for tracking carbon cycles and climate change. The performances of machine learning algorithms under traditional and spatial CV approaches are compared when data collection is achieved using various sampling schemes, such as random, stratified, systematic and non-aligned sampling for samples sizes of 250, 500 and 2000. The results of this study suggested that researchers couple spatially balanced sampling schemes with spatial CV when possible over any other configuration. It demonstrated an improvement in model reliability as sample size increased due to improved precision, but a display of diminishing returns in increased sample sizes for performance accuracy. It found that for small sample sizes non-aligned systematic sampling was the best and most reliable sampling scheme, at medium sizes generalized random tesselation stratified sampling should be used by researchers and that at large sizes the choice of sampling scheme begins to matter less motivating that simple random sampling is best at this stage.
